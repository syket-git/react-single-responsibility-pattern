Hey everyone, In this video I have shared a React machine coding question that was asked to one of my friends recently. React Interview Question implement a single responsibility principle to react component, and along with tips and tricks to tackle your React JS and JavaScript Questions in Frontend Machine Coding Interviews.

#### What is the Single Responsibility Principle? 
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in a React component means that each component should have one specific job or responsibility. It should do one thing and do it well. This makes the component easier to understand, test, and maintain. For example, if you have a component that handles displaying a list of items, it should only focus on that task and not handle unrelated tasks like fetching data or managing state. By keeping components focused, your code stays clean and organized.
